## Usage

```
smdr [OPTIONS] [FILE]...
```

Read from a file:

```sh
smdr README.md
```

Open several files at once — each opens in its own tab:

```sh
smdr README.md CHANGELOG.md docs/index.md
```

Read from stdin:

```sh
cat README.md | smdr
```

!!! tip "Tabs & single window"
    smdr keeps everything in one window. Passing multiple files opens each in
    its own tab, and running `smdr <file>` again while a window is already
    open adds that file as a tab in the **existing** window instead of
    launching a new one — the command returns immediately without blocking
    your shell.

    Opening a file that is already open doesn't create a duplicate: smdr
    switches to its tab and reloads it from disk.

!!! tip "Live file watching"
    Pass `-w` / `--watch` and smdr will monitor the file for changes and
    automatically reload the view whenever you save — ideal for editing
    workflows, documentation previews, and note-taking.

    ```sh
    smdr -w README.md
    ```

    Already viewing a file without `-w`? Press **`Ctrl-R`** at any time
    to manually reload from disk.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-w`, `--watch` | Watch file for changes and auto-reload |
| `-t`, `--theme <THEME>` | Color theme (default: `system`) |
| `--no-network` | Disable network image fetching (use local files only) |
| `--list-themes` | List available themes and exit |

!!! tip "stdin support"
    smdr automatically detects piped input — no flag needed:
    ```sh
    cat README.md | smdr
    man git | smdr
    ```
